				Hi! My name is Christopher Oliveira and this is my online portifolio. Here you will find information about my education and career. I am a 23-year-old English teacher, but as you will see, my experience is not only limited to teaching. This website was entirely developed by me and doubles as a showcase of my programming skills. Feel free to contact me at any time if you need any clarification or wish to hire me.
